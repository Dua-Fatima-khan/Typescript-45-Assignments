//12. Greetings: Start with the array you used in Exercise 11, but instead of just printing each personâ€™s name, print a message to them. The text of each messageshould be the same, but each message should be personalized with the personâ€™s name.

let names: string[] = ["Tabassum Khan", "Dua", "Fatima", "Saba", "Sumbul"];

for (let name of names) {
    console.log(`\nDear ${name}, your presence in my life is a true blessing. May Allah bless you with happiness and success. ðŸŒŸ`);
}
